**Welcome to Aman Bhai's Flutter App**

A simple Flutter app that displays a welcoming message using the Text widget.
Welcome to Aman Bhai's Flutter App is a basic Flutter project that greets users with a friendly message on the screen.
It serves as a starting point for new Flutter developers to understand how to create and structure a simple app using Flutter's widgets.

Once the app is running, you'll see a simple interface with a centered text widget displaying the message "Kaise Ana Hua Jani". This message can be modified in the Text widget within the body of the Scaffold.

Feel free to customize the app's title, app bar text, and the displayed message to suit your preferences. Experiment with different fonts, colors, and styling to create your personalized UI.
